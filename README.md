# pr-spectrum-playground

let's do a spectrum analyzer in stepped increments:

bare minimum:
- [ ] make the bar decrease when it reaches the top instead of reseting
- [ ] draw a 2nd bar on the side
- [ ] border margins
- [ ] draw a configurable number of bars using a loop
- [ ] have each bar have it's own state (value)
- [ ] linear interpolation of external values into the bar's scale

fun part:
- [ ] trailing animation
- [ ] peak value memory
- [ ] LCD effect
